# ESRGAN Implementation i PyTorch
Written by Sindre Stenen Blakseth, June/July 2020.  
Based on the work of:
- Thomas Nakken Larsen
- Duy Tan Huynh Tran
- Eirik Vesterkj√¶r

With guidance from:
- Adil Rasheed
- Trond Kvamsdal

## Disclaimer
This implementation does not produce satisfactory results at the moment. This could be due to any or all of the discrepancies between this work and the original ESRGAN (see below), or some other factor unknown to the author.

## Using the ESRGAN
1. All configuration should be done in config.py. All output files are saved to the specified run_dir or one of its subdirectories.
2. Use main.py for training, testing and dataset management. main.py support the following command line options:
    - --download            (Download raw data.)
    - --dataset             (Create new datasets from raw data.)
    - --train               (Train ESRGAN.)
    - --test                (Test pre-trained ESRGAN.)
3. Use plot_results.py and visualize.py 

## Outputs
By default, the model prints its training losses every 100 iterations to a dedicated .txt-file. Furthermore, every 2000 iterations, it prints the following to two separate .txt-files:

1. Validation losses (file 1).
2. LPIPS and PSNR scores (file 1).
3. Discriminator prediction accuracy on the validation set (file 1).
4. Mean, mean of absolute value, and variance of gradients at select layers in both networks (file 2).
5. Mean of absolute value, and variance of weights at select layers in both networks (file 2).

Every 10 000 iterations, the model stores select LR, HR and SR examples in pickle-files, and also stores the discriminator predictions on these SR and HR examples in a dedicated .txt-file.

The outputing intervals can be changed in the configuration file.

Tensorboard is not used in the current implementation.

## Default configuration

Most of the configurations are lifted directly from the ESRDGAN implementation of Eirik Vesterkj√¶r.
These differ from those of the original ESRGAN in a number of ways, though no justification of these changes is know to the author of this implementation.
The discrepancies between this repo and the original ESRGAN are noted below.
Anyone interested in using this model for research should first check if the original ESRGAN parameter choices yield better results than the current configuration when training on normal images.

By default, the following configurations apply:
- Model uses GPU if available.
- Model is in training mode, not in testing mode.
- Model is trained from scratch.
- Training runs for 200 000 iterations (**Original ESRGAN uses more than 300 000**), and the generator is trained every 2nd iteration.
- Losses are printed every 100 iterations.
- The model is saved every 50 000 iterations.
- Validation losses are computed every 2000 iterations.
- Visualization of validation data is performed every 10 000 iterations,
at which point 8 validation images are visualized.
For comparison, bicubic interpolation is also applied to create SR images from the LR validation images.
- Labels are **not** flipped.
- Noisy labels are **not** used.
- Label smoothing is **not** used.
- Instance noise is **not** used.
- All batch sizes are 8. **Original ESRGAN uses 16.**
- Both optimizers use learning rate 1e-4, 0 weight decay and betas 0.9 and 0.999.
- Both learning rate schedulers use gamma 0.5 and steps every 50 000 iterations.
- The metrics LPIPS and PSNR are used during validation and testing.
- For comparison, bicubic interpolation is used to create SR images from all images in the test set.
- Data tag is the name I used for a custom dataset containing roughly 15k images from the Flickr_30k-dataset.
- LR images are 32x32 and HR images are 128x128.
- Generator and discriminator both use leaky relu activation with slope 0.2.
- Generator uses 16 RRDBs with 32 growth channels. **Original ESRGAN uses 32 RRDBs.**
- Discriminator uses the following loss term(s):
    - RaGAN adversarial loss, scaling factor 1.0.
- Generator uses the following loss term(s):
    - RaGAN adversarial loss, scaling factor 5e-3
    - L1 pixel loss, scaling factor 1e-2
    - L1 feature loss, scaling factor 1.0
- Features for the feature loss are extracted from layer 34 of a pre-trained VGG19 network.
- The feature extractor uses standard RGB input normalization.
- The feature extractor does not use batch normalization.
- Initialization scaling parameter for the generator is 0.5. **Original ESRGAN uses 0.1.**
- Initialization scaling parameter for the discriminator is 0.1. **Original ESRGAN value is unknown.**
- Generator uses 128 internal feature channels. **Original ESRGAN uses 64.**
- HR-conv layers in G use a kernel size of 5. **Original ESRGAN uses 3.**
- LeakyReLU with a negative slope of 0.2 is used throughout both the generator and the discriminator.
- The discriminator uses BatchNorm2d with keep_running_stats set to False.
